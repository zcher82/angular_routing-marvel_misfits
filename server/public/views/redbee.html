<p>This Quality Comics character that first appeared in 1940 had no actual
  super power but rather fought with the help of a trained bumblebee named Michael
  who lived inside his belt buckle. If that wasn't lame enough, The Red Bee was
  outfitted in a garish costume consisting of puffy pink sleeves and striped tights.</p>
