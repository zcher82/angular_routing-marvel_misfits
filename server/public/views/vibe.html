<p>In 1983, DC Comics introduced Paco Ramone, aka Vibe, a break dancing Latino
  who left gang life in Detroit to join The Justice League. While he could create
  force vibrations, a power that proved pretty useful, he spent most of his time
  hitting on women and getting down at nightclubs. His partying days didnâ€™t last
  long; Vibe was killed off in the mid '80s and never returned for an encore</p>
